# credit-card-fraud-detection-using-ML-algorithms-and-bigdata-tools
This project we have used ML algorithms and big data tools
Due to the increasing number of customers as well as the increasing number of companies that 
use credit cards for ending financial transactions, the number of fraud cases has increased 
dramatically. Dealing with noisy and imbalanced data, as well as with outliers, has accentuated 
this problem. In this work, fraud detection using machine learning algorithms is proposed. The 
proposed system uses logistic- regression, SVM, Random-Forest, Decision-Tree and Na√ØveBayes to build the classifier to prevent frauds in credit card transactions. To handle dirty data 
and to ensure a high degree of detection accuracy, a pre-processing step is used. The preprocessing step uses two novel main methods to clean the data: the mean-based method ,over 
sampling ,under sampling and the SMOTE-based method. Compared to two well-known 
classifiers, the Decision-Tree machine classifier shows better results in terms of accuracy, 
sensitivity, and error rate. And we have used data-analytics algorithm CNN for classification of 
the data to find accuracy
